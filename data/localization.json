          "content": "In Maybancal, Morong, Rizal, Philippines, there lived a simple lady named Constantina T. San Antonio, known for her kind-heartedness, truthfulness and above all very pious indeed.\nOne day during a high school examination, she felt dizzy. Her kind teacher gave her first aid and a glass of water. When she regained her senses, Constantina recalled clearly that as she was trying to cope, her head tilted downward, someone in a long dress standing with bare feet caught her eyes and as she tried to look upward to see the face, she passed out."

When she was eating she heard the call of whom she supposed was a beggar. She looked out and saw an old bearded man with a big cloth pouch tied on the cane he was holding. Constantina did not even had a cent to give and was forced to ask for an excuse from the poor beggar. The beggar left followed by the eyes of Constantina and to her surprise, the beggar disappeared upon reaching the “is-is” tree just around five meters away from their house."

His earthly name, A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR.\nThe people observed the change in her voice, appearance, and behavior whenever the spirit is in her. Her voice was small and deep as if coming from within. They referred to the Spirit as \"Tinig\" meaning voice."

Constantina took the pills intended for three(3) days in one (1) dosage. She never slept and continued preaching.\nThe family brought her an old herbalist/faith healer who performed alum healing (pagtatawas) wherein the picture of an old man with a beard transformed from the liquefied alum. Later, another faith healer tied a hanky on the forehead of Constantina saying if the spirit in her is evil, she would remove it, otherwise, good spirit is reigning. The latter happened. Constantina continued preaching with the hanky on her forehead and the people who gathered to listen to her teachings came in bigger quantities."

Some went there for curiosity. Some of them just wanted to listen while others wanted a cure for their illnesses. There are those who just wanted to seek lost items, some others asked for solutions for their problems.\nThe people became familiar with the voice of A.C.D.U.D.U.M. and felt at ease to respond when He called them by their real names, sometimes by other names, just as “Tancing” was how He called Constantina.\nThey were amazed by His use of figurative phrases that were expounded into real life scenarios. When He spoke about the future of the world, He joked to dispel the creeping fear among them. They could feel His love for the people and His earnest desire to save them. When preaching was about to end, his constant words were \"I will leave now.\""

We were dragged towards the door and sent us out,\", according to a follower of Constantina. The actions and remarks of the Parish Priest hurt the family and the followers of A.C.D.U.D.U.M."
