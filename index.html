                  <p class="text-muted">In Maybancal, Morong, Rizal, Philippines, there lived a simple lady, Constantina
                    T. San Antonio, known for her kind-heartedness, truthfulness and above all very pious indeed.She
                    narrated that one day during a high school examination, she felt dizzy. Her kind teacher gave her
                    first aid and a glass of water. When she regained her senses, Constantina recalled clearly that as
                    she was trying to cope, her head tilted downward, someone in a long dress standing with bare feet
                    caught her eyes and as she tried to look upward to see the face, she passed out.</p>

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">One day in July 1955, Constantina was washing clothes in the well about 10
                    meters away from their yard, feeling hungry she went up to the house alone. When she was eating she
                    heard the call of whom she supposed was a beggar. She looked out and saw an old bearded man with a
                    big cloth pouch tied on the cane he was holding. Constantina did not even had a cent to give as her
                    step-mother went to the market. She was forced to ask for an excuse from the poor beggar. The beggar
                    left followed by the eyes of Constantina and to her surprise, the beggar disappeared upon reaching
                    the “is-is” tree just around five meters away from their house.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">It was August 10, 1955 when Constantina started to act strangely and preach in a
                    peculiar manner not typical of herself until the second day He introduced himself as the Holy Spirit
                    of God, the Son, with A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR as his wordly name. His voice was small, coming
                    deep from within. </p>

                  <p class="text-muted">The family mistook it as a sign of insanity and feared that, as bunch of
                    listeners gathered to listen to her continuous preaching without sleep and lack of food she might be
                    ill that she was brought to the doctor who gave her sleeping pills. Constantina took the pills
                    intended for three(3) days in one (1) dosage. She never slept and continued preaching.
                    The family brought her an old herbalist/faith healer who performed spiritual healing with the use of
                    alum wherein the picture of an old man with a bread transformed from the liquefied alum. Later,
                    another faith healer, tied a hanky on the forehead of Constantina saying if the spirit in her is
                    evil, she would remove it, otherwise, good spirit is reigning. The latter happened. Constantina
                    continued preaching with the hanky on her forehead and the people who gathered to listen to her
                    teachings came in huge quantity.

                  <p class="text-muted">In May of 1956, at 4 o'clock in the morning, Constantina clearly saw the image
                    of the Blessed Virgin Mary on top of the avocado tree near their house. A few minutes later,
                    according to her, the image disappeared from her sight.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">More and more people came to listen to Constantina about good deeds and good
                    manners. Some of them just wanted to listen while others wanted a cure for their illnesses. There
                    are those who just wanted to seek lost items, some others asked for solutions for their problems.
                    Wherever she went, people followed her even at the Parish church when she preached beside the Holy
                    Nazarene.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">The people observed the change in her voice, appearance, and behavior whenever
                    the spirit is in her. He called people by their real names and sometimes other names seemingly the
                    names that they should have had. “Tancing” was how He called Constantina.</p>

                    the church declared rejection in one of his sermons, telling the people not to believe Constantina’s
                    words because she is insane. The people believed the priest criticized and ridiculed Constantina.

                    believed in the Spirit. Because of this, seven hundred seventy two (772) of her followers, then
                    decided to organize a religious group separate from the Roman Catholic or any other existing
                    religions.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">That step made Malayang Mananampalataya Church an independent Christian religion

            <h4>FAITH</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">True faith is the right practice of commandments and teachings of God that a religion
              implements to its followers. A Godly person has a strong will to suppress the weak emotions in order to
              resist evil and instead, do good deeds besides being pious and knows how to play along with the different
              behavior of other people. Our Lord wants us to be practical and simple with our faith, not lavish.</p>

            <h4>CONSCIENCE</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Conscience is a grain of power that God endowed in each of His creatures so that He
              can faithfully judge what man thinks and does, whether good or bad. The conscience is a small voice inside
              us and tells us whether our deeds are right or wrong.</p>

            <h4>CONFESSION</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">We do not confess our sins to a priest. The proper confession is to ask forgiveness to
              the person whom you committed a sin and to Him.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">The true meaning of Good Friday is to remember the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ
              and to repent of the sins and trying not to repeat the same sins again. Fasting and physically hurting
              oneself will not make up for and redeem our sins. We do not restrict ourselves to taking a bath and eating
              meat on the season of lent.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">The meaning of Christmas is love, giving,, mutual support. forgiveness and should be
              done not only during the holidays but every day. December 15 is the Christmas celebration of our church
              because according to A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR, that is the date He descended to earth.</p>

            <h4>PURGATORY AND HELL</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">A.C.D.U.D.U.M clearly stated that there is a place for screening the souls for what
              they did during their life on earth, good or bad. Thus, there is a place and process for screening. Hell
              is not a place but a situation or condition here on earth and even in the afterlife. It means problems
              like poverty in money, disease, etc.</p>
