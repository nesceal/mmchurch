                  <p class="text-muted">In Maybancal, Morong, Rizal, Philippines, there lived a simple lady named
                    Constantina T. San Antonio, known for her kind-heartedness, truthfulness and above all very pious
                    indeed.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">One day during a high school examination, she felt dizzy. Her kind teacher gave
                    her first aid and a glass of water. When she regained her senses, Constantina recalled clearly that
                    as she was trying to cope, her head tilted downward, someone in a long dress standing with bare feet
                    caught her eyes and as she tried to look upward to see the face, she passed out.</p>

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">One day in July 1955, Constantina was washing clothes in the well about 10
                    meters away from their yard, feeling hungry she went up to the house alone. When she was eating she
                    heard the call of whom she supposed was a beggar. She looked out and saw an old bearded man with a
                    big cloth pouch tied on the cane he was holding. Constantina did not even had a cent to give and was
                    forced to ask for an excuse from the poor beggar. The beggar left followed by the eyes of
                    Constantina and to her surprise, the beggar disappeared upon reaching the “is-is” tree just
                    around five meters away from their house.

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">On August 10, 1955, Constantina started to act strangely and preach in a
                    peculiar manner not typical of herself until the second day He identified himself as the Spirit of
                    the Holy Son of God, the Savior of the human race.. His earthly name, A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-muted">The people observed the change in her voice, appearance, and behavior whenever
                    the spirit is in her. Her voice was small and deep as if coming from within. They referred to the
                    Spirit as “ Tinig” meaning voice.</p>

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">The family mistook it as a sign of insanity and feared that continuous preaching
                    without sleep and lack of food she might be ill that she was brought to the doctor who gave her
                    sleeping pills. Constantina took the pills intended for three(3) days in one (1) dosage. She never
                    slept and continued preaching.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">The family brought her an old herbalist/faith healer who performed alum healing
                    (pagtatawas) wherein the picture of an old man with a beard transformed from the liquefied alum.
                    Later, another faith healer tied a hanky on the forehead of Constantina saying if the spirit in her
                    is evil, she would remove it, otherwise, good spirit is reigning. The latter happened. Constantina
                    continued preaching with the hanky on her forehead and the people who gathered to listen to her
                    teachings came in bigger quantities.</p>

                    image disappeared from her sight.</p>

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">The news about a preaching God in the person of Constantina spread across the
                    nearby towns. Groups of people from Morong and the neighboring towns flocked to their house.) Some
                    went there for curiosity. Some of them just wanted to listen while others wanted a cure for their
                    illnesses. There are those who just wanted to seek lost items, some others asked for solutions for
                    their problems.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">The people became familiar with the voice of A.C.D.U.D.U.M. and felt at ease to
                    respond when He called them by their real names, sometimes by other names, just as “Tancing” was how
                    He called Constantina.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">They were amazed by His use of figurative phrases that were expounded into real
                    life scenarios. When He spoke about the future of the world, He joked to dispel the creeping fear
                    among them. They could feel His love for the people and His earnest desire to save them. When
                    preaching was about to end, his constant words were "I will leave now."</p>

                    she preached beside the Holy Nazarene. She continued preaching, treating the sick day and night,
                    despite the insults of other people until the Parish Priest of the church declared rejection in one
                    of his sermons, telling the people twice not to believe Constantina’s words for she is insane.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted">“You know what the Priest did to us while praying near the Holy Nazarene at the
                    church? We were dragged towards the door and sent us out,”, according to a follower of Constantina.
                    The actions and remarks of the Parish Priest hurt the family and the followers of A.C.D.U.D.U.M.

                    to organize a religious group separate from the Roman Catholic or any other existing religions.
                    That step made Malayang Mananampalataya Church a registered, independent Christian religion that is
                    now known to exist from 1955 to the present with its own Sacraments, prayers, teachings and
                    teachings from the Holy Spirit of God the Son A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR, the savior of mankind.

            <h4>THE EYE</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Three Persons in One God - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God, the Father
              is watching over his creatures and nothing can be hidden from Him, bad and good deeds. God, the Son who
              descended to earth from heaven to spread His teachings on righteousness and save humanity.
              God, the Holy Spirit, guides the people to what is true, what is right and what is good.

            <h4>A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The earthly name of the One, True Son of God and Savior of mankind who took the role
              of a humble Shepherd to fulfill His mission. His clothing, appropriate for a Shepherd, is truly a
              symbol of humility.

            <h4>VIRGIN MARY, MOTHER OF MERCY</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">She symbolizes women. She is the Light that guides us and intercedes for us in our
              Lord so that we can be forgiven of our sins.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>CONSCIENCE</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Conscience is a grain of power that God endowed to each of His creatures so that He
              can faithfully judge what man thinks and does, whether good or bad. The conscience which dwells in us is a
              small voice from our inner being that affirms whether our behavior is right or wrong.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item">
          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>CONFESSION</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">We do not confess our sins to a priest. The proper confession is to ask forgiveness
              from the person whom you committed a sin and from Him.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item">
          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>THE CROSS AND THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The cross represents Three Persons in One God - the Father, the Son, and the Holy
              Spirit, thus making a sign of the cross is recognizing and honoring the Three Persons in One God, and
              believing in their power. The sign of a cross is also a prayer in itself. Jesus was not crucified. With
              that said, we use the plain, bare cross, not the crucifix.</p>

          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>GOOD FRIDAY</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The true meaning of Good Friday is remembering the teachings of the Son of God, our
              Savior, repentance of sins, and striving hard not to repeat the same sins again. We do not practice
              fasting and abstinence and do not restrict bathing. Hurting oneself physically to inflict pain will not
              redeem a person from his sins.</p>

          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>PURGATORY AND HELL</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">A.C.D.U.D.U.M. didn’t use the term purgatory, He clearly stated there is a process of
              filtering and there is a place where the souls of people are screened based on what they did while they
              were still alive, good and bad deeds. Hell is not a place but a state of suffering in different aspects of
              life here on earth and even in the afterlife.</p>

          <div class="portfolio-caption">
            <h4>CHRISTMAS</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The meaning of Christmas is love, giving, mutual support. Forgiveness and should be
              done not only during the holidays but every day. December 15 is the Christmas celebration of our church
              because according to A.C.D.U.D.U.M. NIÑO DE PASTOR, that is the date when He descended to earth. </p>

            <h4>OUR VIEW OF THE BIBLE</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">The teachings of A.C.D.U.D.U.M. Niño De Pastor that are realistic and actually
              happening everyday have led this religion to the idea that the teachings should not be based on
              the bible.
